          Our project is been designed with the view to solve this problem. One of the main reason that there is so much improper management of of these waste is lack of knowledge that how to recycle them. We in our project are going to make the people aware about this and also will help them to reach to the right person to sell it. It is a business in the sense which will encourage people to recycle garbage. In this the companies which produce large amount of recyclable waste will also find the right buyers to do so. The project will be great sucess as ethical as well as the business perspective as the recycling industry in India is already of the worth 15 million dollar. This app will make more money to both buyer's as well as sellers.Recyclo is concerned with the improvisation of the waste management system that exist within the country. The current system has an immensed scope in extention of of the business. The app will direct the users to properly identify the waste and to get it to the proper recycler around them. In the existing system the vendors come to each household to collect the garabage and the houdeholds need to sell their recyclable goods at whatever price they offer. The website will help the people to get the best dealers who will give the best price for the  goods.
